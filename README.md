# Dayz_1.18
Dayz wallhack for current game version
Functionalities: wallhack (information about enemy position, distance (in meters), current session time(in seconds))<br /><br />
Overall informaation: color indicates distance for easier orientation (<200m = green; 200 = red; >200m blue; dead = black, watch screenshots); first number under enemy is distance; second number - time of current session in seconds (updates every two seconds coz of technical issues).<br /><br />
Controls: Enter - clear dead bodies from displaying; k - change display type; 8 + 9 (keyboard, pressed at the same time while looking at the ground) - update local player (in case you see information displaying under your player, watch localPlayerBug.png)<br /><br />
Warning1: cheat can decrease your FPS (by 4-5% in my case); driver part of cheat won't load if any kernel anticheat is currently working (if you have faceit anticheat installed you have to unload it with task manager or uninstall, any other kernel anticheat turns off with the game it used in)<br /><br />
Loading cheat: Run Dayz_1.18.sys with kdmapper (by dragging icon of Dayz_1.18.sys to kdmapper) console window will pop up for few milliseconds. Now join any server and as soon as you're fully loaded you can run Dayz_1.18.exe. If you want to turn off cheat just close console window. If you wan't to fully turn off cheat (wich you have to do to be able to play games with "easyanticheat") you have to restart your pc.<br /><br />

Warning2: Current version is only on testing stage, so if you have any problems let me know in discord<br />
Safety: Including shortness of testing period and low profile cheat is as safe as it can get (personaly used it for few weeks now).<br /><br />
